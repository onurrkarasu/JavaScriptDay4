   ! Conditionals

    Conditionals statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default, statements in JavaScript script executed
    sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequantial flow of execution can be altered in two says : 

        * Conditional execution : a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expressions is true
        * Repetitive execution : a block of one more statements will be repetitively executed as long as certain expressions is true. In this section,
        * we will cover if , else, else if statements. The comparison ang logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here.
    
    ! Conditions can be implementing using the following ways : 

        * if 
        * if else
        * if else if else
        * switch
        * ternary
